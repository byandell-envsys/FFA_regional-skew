code,description
agency_cd,The agency that is reporting the data. Agency codes are fixed values assigned by the National Water Information System (NWIS).
site_no,Each site in the USGS data base has a unique 8- to 15-digit identification number.
station_nm,This is the official name of the site in the database. For well information this can be a district-assigned local number.
site_tp_cd,"A list of primary and secondary site types that can be associated with data collection sites. A site type is a generalized location in the hydrologic cycle, or a man-made feature thought to affect the hydrologic conditions measured at a site. All sites are associated with a primary site type, and may additionally be associated with a secondary site type that further describes the location."
dec_lat_va,Latitude in decimal degrees
dec_long_va,Longitude in decimal degrees
coord_acy_cd,Lat/Long coordinate accuracy codes indicating the accuracy of the latitude longitude values.
dec_coord_datum_cd,Lat/Long coordinate datum.
alt_va,Altitude of the site referenced to the specified Vertical Datum
alt_acy_va,Altitude accuracy value. Many altitudes are interpolated from the contours on topographic maps; accuracies determined in this way are generally entered as one-half of the contour interval.
alt_datum_cd,Altitude coordinate datum.
huc_cd,"Hydrologic unit codes. The United States is divided and sub-divided into successively smaller hydrologic units which are classified into four levels: regions, sub-regions, accounting units, and cataloging units. The hydrologic units are arranged within each other, from the smallest (cataloging units) to the largest (regions). Each hydrologic unit is identified by a unique hydrologic unit code (HUC) consisting of two to eight digits based on the four levels of classification in the hydrologic unit system."
data_type_cd,"All USGS data falls into one of: Current Conditions, Daily Data, Surface Water, Water Quality, Groundwater. Current condition data is any data down to the 15 minute interval that has been transmitted in the last 120 days. Daily Data is the average daily value for a site. Surface Water is water flow and levels in streams, lakes and springs. Water Quality is chemical and physical data for streams, lakes, springs, and wells. Groundwater is water levels in wells."
parm_cd,Parameter code
stat_cd,Statistics code
ts_id,"Time-series ID. The ts_id is a surrogate key assigned and used by the database for efficient queries of data and for download or display as a list, table, or graph."
loc_web_ds,Additional measurement description
medium_grp_cd,"Medium type refers to the specific environmental medium that was sampled and analyzed. Medium type differs from site type because one site type, such as surface water, could have data for several media, such as water, bottom sediment, fish tissue, and others."
parm_grp_cd,Parameter group code
srs_id,USEPA SRS.http://www.epa.gov/srs/
access_cd,Access code
begin_date,Begin date of the period of record for the data
end_date,End date of the period of record for the data
count_nu,Number of records
na_l3_cde,"User-generated code for level-3 ecoregion names, where 'ngp' = 'Northern Great Plains' and 'hp' = High Plains"
