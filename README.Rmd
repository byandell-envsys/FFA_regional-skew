## Project Overview

This project supports the estimation of regional skew coefficients for flood frequency analysis (FFA) in the Great Plains. It emphasizes:

-   Reproducibility through scripted, transparent workflows

-   Modular data processing for climate, terrain, and hydrography

-   Integration of spatial covariates to improve estimation accuracy

Flood frequency analysis estimates the magnitude and frequency of peak flow events by fitting a probability distribution to the annual maximum instantaneous discharge recorded at streamflow gaging stations. These estimates are foundational for risk-based hydrologic design, including delineation of the 100-year floodplain.

One of the core challenges in FFA is that short periods of record often result in unstable or biased flood magnitude estimates—especially for rare events. To mitigate this, Bulletin 17C recommends combining the station skew (based on site-specific data) with a regional skew coefficient to stabilize flood estimates *see footnote 1*.

However, standardized procedures for calculating robust regional skew coefficients remain underdeveloped. This project addresses that gap by integrating spatial and climatic covariates into a reproducible modeling workflow designed to improve regional estimation.

## Phase Objectives

The primary goals of this phase are twofold:

-   To explain spatial variation in station skew, defined as the skew coefficient of the Log-Pearson Type III distribution estimated at individual stream gages. This is accomplished by modeling skew as a function of numeric covariates derived from:

-   
     Ecoregions (ecological and physiographic classifications)


-   Geographic Location (latitude and longitude)

-   Climate (e.g., precipitation and temperature normals)

-   Topography (elevation, slope, and terrain indices)


-   Watershed Characteristics (drainage area, shape, etc.)


-   Land Cover (vegetation, impervious surfaces, etc.)

-   To identify clusters of gaging stations with similar characteristics based on these covariates. These clusters will serve as the basis for calculating regional skew coefficients tailored to stream discharge gages on Tribal lands within the Great Plains ecoregion.

## Layout of Analysis

This project is implemented in R using the {tidyverse} and related tools to automate a reproducible workflow for downloading, cleaning, joining, and modeling covariate data associated with stream gage locations.

### Study Domain

The study focuses on stream gaging stations within the Great Plains ecoregion. An initial inventory included approximately 11,000 stations across the contiguous U.S. After filtering out sites with flow regulation, water withdrawals, or insufficient record length, a final set of \~1,100 gages was retained for analysis. Each of these stations has more than 20 years of peak flow data and meets data quality criteria suitable for estimating flood skew.

### Covariates and Multiscale Design Framework

Covariates span four major domains:

-   Climate (e.g., precipitation, temperature normals)

-   Land Cover (e.g., impervious surface fraction, vegetation types)

-   Topography (e.g., elevation, slope, terrain curvature)

-   Watershed Metrics (e.g., drainage area, shape indices)

To capture spatial heterogeneity and support robust regionalization, covariates are organized into a hierarchical, multi-scale framework. Variables are calculated at five spatial scales:

-   Scale 0: Station-specific (point-level)

-   Scale 1: Local (NHD+ catchment)

-   Scale 2: Subregional (EPA Level III Ecoregions)

-   Scale 3: Regional (EPA Level II Ecoregions)

-   Scale 4: Macroregional (custom prairie macrozones derived from Level II groupings)

This design balances thematic depth and spatial resolution. Regional and local-scale metrics are prioritized within the Climate and Topography domains to reflect key drivers of flood skew. Macroregional variables offer contextual information (e.g., climate zones, land cover fractions), while fine-scale metrics (e.g., slope, flow accumulation) support physically-based interpretation of runoff generation and hydrograph response.

The table below summarizes the number of covariates at each spatial scale and domain:

```{r gp_variable_scaffold, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

  "Regional", "Level II Ecoregion", 4, 4, 4, 5, 17,

  "Local", "NHD+ catchments", 3, 2, 8, 4, 17
)

```

## Covariate Description by Spatial Scale

### Station-Level Geospatial and Watershed Metadata

These point-based covariates describe intrinsic site characteristics that serve as fixed inputs in hydrologic modeling:

-   Longitude and Latitude capture spatial position, often used to model climatic or physiographic gradients across the study domain.

-   Station Altitude represents elevation above sea level, influencing temperature regime, snow persistence, and runoff timing.

-   Watershed Area defines the total upstream contributing area and is a key spatial predictor in flood frequency analysis and hydrologic scaling.

### Macroscale Environmental Covariates (Prairie Macrozones)

These covariates provide broad contextual information at the macroregional scale, capturing dominant environmental regimes:

-   Climate Zone and PHZM Zone (Dominant) describe prevailing climatic and cold-hardiness conditions.

-   PHZM Zone Count reflects climate transition diversity across zones.

-   Land Cover Fractions—including Cropland, Forest, Grassland, and Urban—represent land use intensity and vegetative cover, informing evapotranspiration, infiltration, and surface runoff.

-   Terrain attributes, such as Mean Slope, Median Slope, and Altitude Zone, describe large-scale elevational patterns and slope regimes that shape snow accumulation, melt timing, and runoff velocity.

### Regional Environmental Covariates (Level II Ecoregions)

These covariates represent regionally coherent environmental conditions:

-   Annual Temperature and Annual Precipitation establish baseline thermal and moisture regimes.

-   Warm-season precipitation (Pct May–Aug) captures convective storm patterns and seasonality.

-   Vegetation dynamics—via NDVI Amplitude, IQR, Peak NDVI, and Growing Season Length—reflect primary productivity and climatic responsiveness.

-   Terrain complexity is quantified by Mean Slope, Slope Skewness, and Slope Variability, indicating energy for runoff and erosive potential.

-   Soil Texture Fractions (Clay, Silt, Sand) influence infiltration rates and runoff production.

-   Stream Order (Median and Max) characterizes the scale and branching complexity of river networks within the region.

### Subregional Environmental Covariates (Level III Ecoregions)

At the subregional scale, these covariates emphasize intra-annual variability and land-use heterogeneity:

-   Seasonal precipitation metrics (Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer Precip; Seasonal StDev; IQR) describe moisture availability and flood timing potential.

-   MODIS Land Cover % and Diversity Index quantify vegetation type and fragmentation.

-   Soil Permeability and Runoff Class characterize surface infiltration and hydrologic response potential.

    Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)—represented by Mean, Modal, and Class—describes terrain–moisture interactions relevant to saturation and runoff.

-   Flow Accumulation indicates upslope contributing area, offering insight into drainage convergence and flood-prone zones.

### Local Hydrologic and Terrain Covariates (Catchment Scale)

These high-resolution variables, derived at the catchment scale (\~1–5 km²), characterize detailed physiographic and hydrologic conditions:

-   Climatic intensity metrics such as Freeze–Thaw Days, Precipitation Intensity, and Wet Day Frequency capture small-scale climatic variability.

-   NLCD Land Cover % and Diversity Index describe dominant land use and fragmentation effects on hydrologic processes.

-   Terrain morphology, including Elevation Range, Aspect (Cos/Sin), Curvature (Planform, Profile, IQR), and Relief Ratio, defines slope, concavity, and potential energy gradients.

-   Watershed geometry via Elongation Ratio and Circularity Ratio provides insight into hydrograph timing and flood peak characteristics.

-   Drainage network structure is described by Stream Density, Flow Length, and Stream Slope, which together determine runoff velocity, timing, and erosive potential.

## Methods Notes

### Spatial Unit Merging Procedure

To ensure statistical robustness in regional analyses, polygons smaller than 1,000 km² or containing fewer than 30 stream gages were merged with the most ecologically similar adjacent Level III ecoregions. The merging process followed a hierarchical decision rule:

-   Primary criterion: adjacency with a unit sharing the same Level II ecoregion classification

-   Secondary criterion: ecological similarity, evaluated using Euclidean distance in a multivariate space defined by:

-   Land cover composition (e.g., cropland, forest, urban fractions)

-   Terrain metrics (mean and standard deviation of slope)

-   Vegetation seasonality (NDVI amplitude and timing of peak greenness)

This approach preserved regional coherence while improving the gage count and spatial contiguity required for reliable skew estimation.

### Rationale for Using 2016 as the Reference Year

The year 2016 was selected as the reference year for environmental covariates due to its widespread use and stability in environmental modeling. Key justifications include:

-   It lies near the midpoint of the 1991–2020 climatological normal period, making it representative of typical conditions.

-   Data for 2016—such as MODIS NDVI, NLCD land cover, and PRISM climate products—are:

    -   Publicly available

    -   Pre-processed and high quality

    -   Free of major anomalies or interruptions

-   Unlike years affected by extreme events (e.g., megadroughts or COVID-19), 2016 offers a stable baseline for reproducibility.

-   It is also commonly adopted by agencies such as NASA, USGS, and NOAA as a benchmark year for geospatial and ecological analysis.

By standardizing on 2016, this project supports consistent, comparable modeling across datasets and scales.

## Attribution of Prairie Macrozone Delineation

The delineation of prairie macrozones (Tallgrass, Mixed-Grass, and Shortgrass) in this study is based on aggregations of EPA Level III and IV Ecoregions1, guided by ecological, climatic, and physiographic criteria. Boundaries were refined using expert knowledge of prairie vegetation transitions, precipitation gradients, soil characteristics, and land use patterns.

*Where necessary, Level IV subdivisions were used to capture ecological nuance within broader Level III units.* The classification emphasizes hydrologically relevant differences in vegetation structure, infiltration dynamics, and climate variability, consistent with literature on prairie ecosystem function and landscape hydrology. This approach allows spatial generalization while preserving ecologically meaningful variability across the Great Plains region. 

 The grouping captures regions with similar hydroclimatic dynamics and strong surface–subsurface hydrologic connectivity, important for flood response and baseflow recharge.

    -   Panicum virgatum (Switchgrass)

    -   Sorghastrum nutans (Indiangrass)

Hydrologically, this zone exhibits strong vegetation–soil feedbacks:

-   strong surface–subsurface hydrologic connectivity,

-   9.2.3 Western Corn Belt Plains (US 47): Nearly flat to gently rolling glaciated till plains and hilly loess plains,

-   9.2.4 Central Irregular Plains (US 40): Rolling and irregular plains with loess overlying glacial till in the north,

-   9.4.4 Flint Hills (US 28): Steep terrain with shallow limestone soils; fire-maintained tallgrass remnant.

-   9.5.1 Western Gulf Coastal Plain (US 34): Nearly flat coastal plain.

### Mixed-Grass Prairie Macrozone

The Mixed-Grass Prairie macrozone is a transitional zone between the wetter Tallgrass systems and the drier Shortgrass steppes characterized by:

-   Moderate precipitation (typically 500–800 mm)

-   strong interannual precipitation variability,

-   A mixture of tall, mid, and short grass species, including

    -   Bouteloua curtipendula (sideoats grama),
    
    -   Bouteloua gracilis (sideoats grama),
    
    -   Stipa sp. (Needlegrass species)

This zone Hydrologically, this zone exhibits a spatially heterogeneous
hydrologically dynamic system with: 

-   moderate infiltration and runoff, and

-   variable soil texture.

Level III and IV ecoregions in the Mixed-Grass Prairie macrozone include U.S portions of Level II ecoregions: the West Central Semi-Arid Prairies (9.3), central portions of the South Central Semiarid Prairies (9.4), and uplands portions of the Tamaulipas-Texas Semi-Arid Plain (9.6).

-   9.6.1 Southwestern Tablelands (US 26) upland areas 

    -    Canadian/Cimarron Breaks (26a)

    -    Semiarid Canadian Breaks (26d)

### Shortgrass Prairie Macrozone

The Shortgrass Prairie macrozone marks the xeric end of the gradient, characterized by:

-   Low precipitation

-   Sparse vegetation

-   Shallow soils and limited infiltration

Level III and IV ecoregions in the Shortgrass Prairie macrozone include portions of Level II ecoregions: western portions of the South Central Semiarid Prairies (9.4), and lowlands portions of the Tamaulipas-Texas Semi-Arid Plain (9.6).

-   9.4.1 Western High Plains (US 25) western subregions (25a, 25c, 25e to 25l)

-   9.4.2 Central Great Plains (US 27): western extents with lower rainfall and shortgrass cover.

-   9.6.1 Southwestern Tablelands (US 26) lowlands areas (25b, 25c, 25e to 25q)







Hydrologic behavior in this macrozone is dominated by rapid surface runoff and higher flood skew, driven by reduced canopy structure and limited ET buffering.

 and the southern and western portions of the South Central Semiarid Prairies. These areas experience low annual precipitation, high evapotranspiration, and limited canopy cover. Vegetation is dominated by drought-adapted short grasses such as blue grama and buffalograss. This macrozone reflects ecosystems with reduced infiltration, elevated runoff ratios, and rapid hydrologic response, making it distinct from more mesic prairie types.
