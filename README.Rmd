title: "Regional Skew Estimation Workflow"
output: md_document
---

## Overview

This project supports the development of regional skew estimation for flood frequency analysis. The workflow automates data download, cleaning, and organization of USGS NWIS and WQP data for unregulated stream gages with sufficient record length.

## Workflow Overview

| Milestone | Script | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| 01        | 01_get-spatial-data.R        | Download and clean HUC, ecoregion, and gage spatial data. |
| 02        | 02_get-gage-data.R           | Query peak flow records for all USGS sites in bounding box. |
| 03        | 03_filter_unregulated_gage_data.R | Filter gages to unregulated sites with ≥20 years of data. |
| 04        | 04_find_clean_export_site_summaries.R | Query NWIS and WQP for site metadata, clean, and export site summaries. |

## Data Notes

- `/data/raw/` contains raw unprocessed data pulled directly from APIs.
- `/data/clean/` contains final processed data used in analysis.
- All scripts are named and numbered to reflect the workflow order.
- Custom helper functions are in `/functions/`.
