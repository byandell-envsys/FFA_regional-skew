 "site_tp_cd", "A list of primary and secondary site types that can be associated with data collection sites. A site type is a generalized location in the hydrologic cycle, or a man-made feature thought to affect the hydrologic conditions measured at a site. All sites are associated with a primary site type, and may additionally be associated with a secondary site type that further describes the location.",

The United States is divided and sub-divided into successively smaller hydrologic units which are classified into four levels: regions, sub-regions, accounting units, and cataloging units. The hydrologic units are arranged within each other, from the smallest (cataloging units) to the largest (regions). Each hydrologic unit is identified by a unique hydrologic unit code (HUC) consisting of two to eight digits based on the four levels of classification in the hydrologic unit system.",

Current condition data is any data down to the 15 minute interval that has been transmitted in the last 120 days. Daily Data is the average daily value for a site. Surface Water is water flow and levels in streams, lakes and springs. Water Quality is chemical and physical data for streams, lakes, springs, and wells. Groundwater is water levels in wells.",
