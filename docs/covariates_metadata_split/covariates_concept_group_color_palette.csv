Climate Patterns,macroclimate; zonal baseline; long-term climate; regional climate classification; seasonal norms,Blue,#377EB8,"Cool and stable, evokes sky and atmospheric background",Sky Blue,#5DADE2,"Reflects stable atmospheric background—calm, broad-scale blue sky."
Climate Variability,precipitation variability; temperature fluctuation; freeze–thaw; storm frequency; intra-annual variation,Orange,#FF7F00,"Bright and warm, suggests variability and seasonality",Orange-Red,#E67E22,"Suggests variability and flux—like weather changes, fire, or intense heat."
Land Cover,land cover composition; NLCD; MODIS; surface type; use type; spatial heterogeneity,Brown,#A65628,"Earthy, natural—associated with soil exposure and land surfaces",Earth Brown,#935116,"Neutral, grounded tone associated with land use and soil exposure."
Vegetation Indices,NDVI; vegetation productivity; seasonal greenness; phenology; growing season metrics,Green,#4DAF4A,"Represents greenness, plant growth, and NDVI metrics",Leaf Green,#27AE60,"Natural choice for greenness, biomass, and NDVI-related variables."
Topography,elevation; slope; aspect; terrain ruggedness; curvature; terrain morphology,Gray,#999999,"Neutral and subdued, works well for background terrain features",Slate Gray,#566573,"Suggests rock, elevation, and relief. Easy to contrast against green/blue."
