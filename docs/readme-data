1. Project Title: 
Regional Flood Frequency Analysis

2. Project Description: 
This project explores regionalization of skewness coefficients for annual peak 
floods using clustering and regression methods.

 to guide the selection of 
    peak flow gage data. 
    
    0.5 -- getting started with what I done
DL Level 1 and 2 Ecoregions
DL metadata for level 2 -- https://dmap-prod-oms-edc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ORD/Ecoregions/cec_na/NA_CEC_Eco_Level2.htm

# Next Steps:
# Update script to subset Level 1-4 ecoregions as: Level 1 == "Great Plains"
# Remove area calculation -- which does not make sense for unprojected data
#


# coordinate system for downloading data
# crs:4326     # WGS 84 Geographic; Unit: degree
#
# - for all ecoregion levels -- used ArcGIS Pro to select by attribute --
#  L1_name == Great Plains then exported the results.
#
# - for ecoregion lev1 and lev2 -- clipped extent by lev3 extent
#

4. Setup and Installation

    Environment setup (Conda, renv, requirements.txt, etc.)

    Any necessary credentials, API keys, or .env files (and where to put them)

    Package dependencies

5. How to Run

    Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the analysis.

        Run scripts/01_get-data.R to download spatial data. 
        

# Updates to script
# 2024-06-01 -- Approximate date of project start
# 2025-04-03 -- Begin moving Rmd code into a script
# 2025-04-05 -- Update script metadata

# Purpose: 
# This script obtains spatial data to guide the selection of peak flow gage data.
#    Data are downloaded to a project file as shapefiles 

        e.g. “Run scripts/clean_data.R first to prepare data.”

        “Open notebooks/modeling.qmd to view the model comparison.”

                Issue is in storing processed data locally rather than

Plant hardiness zones are a system used to classify regions based on the average annual minimum winter temperature, helping gardeners determine which plants are likely to survive in a particular area. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:

    What they are:
    The USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map divides North America into 13 zones (based on 10-degree Fahrenheit differences in average annual minimum winter temperatures) to help gardeners choose plants that are likely to survive the coldest winters in their area. 

How they work:
The map is based on the average annual extreme minimum winter temperature, displayed as 10-degree F zones and 5-degree F half zones. 
Why they're important:
They help gardeners select plants that are best suited to their climate, increasing the chances of successful growth and survival. 
Factors beyond hardiness zones:
While hardiness zones are a good starting point, other factors can also influence plant survival, including soil type, drainage, wind, humidity, and microclimates. 
Using the map:
You can find your hardiness zone by using the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map online. 
Examples:

    Zone 3: Can withstand temperatures down to -40°F to -30°F (-40°C to -34.4°C). 

Zone 6: Can withstand temperatures down to -10°F to 0°F (-23.3°C to -17.8°C). 
Zone 10: Can withstand temperatures down to 30°F to 40°F (-1.1°C to 4.4°C).
