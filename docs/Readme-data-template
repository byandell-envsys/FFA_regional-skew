Plant hardiness zones are a system used to classify regions based on the average annual minimum winter temperature, helping gardeners determine which plants are likely to survive in a particular area. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:

    What they are:
    The USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map divides North America into 13 zones (based on 10-degree Fahrenheit differences in average annual minimum winter temperatures) to help gardeners choose plants that are likely to survive the coldest winters in their area. 

How they work:
The map is based on the average annual extreme minimum winter temperature, displayed as 10-degree F zones and 5-degree F half zones. 
Why they're important:
They help gardeners select plants that are best suited to their climate, increasing the chances of successful growth and survival. 
Factors beyond hardiness zones:
While hardiness zones are a good starting point, other factors can also influence plant survival, including soil type, drainage, wind, humidity, and microclimates. 
Using the map:
You can find your hardiness zone by using the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map online. 
Examples:

    Zone 3: Can withstand temperatures down to -40°F to -30°F (-40°C to -34.4°C). 

Zone 6: Can withstand temperatures down to -10°F to 0°F (-23.3°C to -17.8°C). 
Zone 10: Can withstand temperatures down to 30°F to 40°F (-1.1°C to 4.4°C).
