1. Workflow Architecture Notes (Targets / Drake)

    "Chain these in targets or drake pipelines"
    "Consider a targets-based workflow if your scripts are getting complex"

This idea deserves its own milestone when you're ready. For now, just document that you're not ready to commit, but it's on your radar.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Documentation Infrastructure

    "Add a log_README.md in each R/ subfolder to document script purpose"
    "Use both .Rmd and .md for documentation"
    "Add a data_dictionary.csv in data/meta/"

âœ… What to do with this: Create a separate Milestone titled:

Milestone 02 â€” Improve Script and Metadata Documentation

With tasks like:

Add README.md to each R/ subfolder to document script roles

Add data/meta/data_dictionary.csv to define covariate metadata

    Add log_README.md template for reproducibility

This is distinct from modeling and essential to reproducibility. It pairs beautifully with a future targets milestone.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Refactor Visualization and Audit

    "00_refactor_checklist.csv", "00_folder_before.png", "00_folder_after.png", "rename_scripts.R"

âœ… What to do with this: If you're doing teaching, writing a paper, or documenting before/after structure, these are great artifacts.

â†’ Move these ideas to a section at the bottom of milestone_00 under:

## Optional Reproducibility Artifacts (Not Tracked in Git Yet)

- `00_refactor_checklist.csv`: CSV to track renaming
- `00_folder_before.png` & `00_folder_after.png`: visuals of structure change
- `rename_scripts.R`: test file renaming via R

OR: add them to a future milestone focused on reproducibility documentation.
ðŸ”¹ 4. Meta Data Organization

    "Step 07 â€” Add data/meta/variable_scaffold.csv and README Tables"
    "Step 08 â€” Distinguish between exploratory output and final cleaned results"

âœ… What to do with this:
â¬‡ Suggest a milestone:

Milestone 04 â€” Organize Metadata and Outputs

- [ ] Create `data/meta/variable_scaffold.csv` for modeling inputs
- [ ] Add variable scaffold to README via `knitr::kable()`
- [ ] Distinguish between exploratory (`output/`) and final outputs (`results/`)

This milestone links to R/03_covariates/ and R/05_eval/, and will improve clarity during modeling and publication prep.

ðŸ§± Suggested Next Steps

Would you like me to:

    Create a milestone_02_documentation.Rmd with the documentation-focused tasks?

    Move these into a reusable future_milestones.Rmd as a long-term planning doc?

    Scaffold the above 3â€“4 milestone headings in a milestones_log.Rmd?

Let me know what fits your style â€” you're building something excellent here.
