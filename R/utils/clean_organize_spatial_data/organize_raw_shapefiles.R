# Title: Organize Shapefile Components into Subfolders
# Author: CJ Tinant
# Date: 2025-04-21
# Description: This script finds all .shp files in data/raw/vector_raw/,
# then moves each .shp and its associated sidecar files into a new folder
# named after the base file (e.g., us_eco_l3/). Logs operations to a .csv file.
