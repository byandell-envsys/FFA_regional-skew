## Ver.0.5 ‚Äì Improve Internal Documentation and Metadata Organization

This milestone focuses on strengthening project transparency and reproducibility by embedding documentation within analysis folders and formalizing metadata management.

> **Summary:** This milestone strengthens reproducibility by formalizing internal documentation practices. It includes README templates for `R/` subfolders, a planned data dictionary, and introduces `log_README.md` documentation inside each milestone to clarify roles, assumptions, and outputs.

### üìù Notes

-   This milestone builds on the modular structure defined in `v0.3-structure-refactor`.
-   `README.md` files will support onboarding, while `.Rmd` logs continue to serve reproducibility.
-   Metadata CSV will ensure clarity when joining covariates to modeling datasets.

### v0.3.4 ‚Äì Final Raw Vector Cleanup

-   Removed all full-CONUS ecoregion shapefiles after confirming Great Plains subsets exist
-   Moved original files to `to_check/archives/`
-   Cleaned up inconsistent naming and verified EPSG strings
-   Repo now ready for reprojection to EPSG:5070 and spatial joins
