# Project Description

## Overview

This project supports the estimation of regional skew coefficients for
flood frequency analysis in the Great Plains. It emphasizes
reproducibility, modular data workflows, and the integration of spatial
and climatic covariates.

The workflow uses R and {tidyverse} tools to automate the download,
cleaning, joining, and modeling of covariate data associated with gage
locations. Covariates include climate normals, terrain characteristics,
and site location variables.

## Goals and Objective

The primary goal of this phase is to explain spatial variation in
station skew ‚Äî the log-Pearson Type III skew coefficient estimated at
individual stream gages ‚Äî using a set of numeric covariates derived from
data related to: Ecological Regions (Ecoregions), Location, Climate,
Topography, Watershed Characteristics, Land Cover Characteristics.

## Layout of Analysis

I adopted a multi-scale hierarchical framework with variables organized
by spatial scale and domain (below). The largest spatial scale is a
custom macroregion based on prairie grassland type, which was derived
from Level II Ecoregions. Other spatial scales include a regional scale
at the Level II Ecoregion extent, a subregional scale at the Level III
Ecoregion extent, and a local catchment level scale at the NHD+ extent
(Figure 2).

| Scale | Extent | Climate | Land Cover | Topography | Watershed | Total |
|:---|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Macroregional | Custom Macrozone | 3 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 13 |
| Regional | Level II Ecoregion | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 17 |
| Subregional | Level III Ecoregion | 6 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 15 |
| Local | NHD+ catchments | 3 | 2 | 8 | 4 | 17 |

## Getting Started

Run scripts in order within the `R/` folder. For example:

    source("R/01_download/01_get_spatial_data.R")
    source("R/02_clean/03_filter_unregulated_gage_data.R")

All scripts assume R project is opened at the repository root (e.g.,
using .Rproj file).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reproducibility

This project uses: - `.gitignore_spatial_template.txt` to exclude large
geospatial files - `git_commit_reference_card.txt` for consistent commit
messages - Modular milestone logs (see `reports/`) to track key
development stages

## Reports and Milestone Logs

To explore the evolution of the project structure, covariate design, and
documentation practices, see: üìÅ
[`reports/README.md`](reports/README.md) ‚Äî Overview of all milestone
logs, reference tools, and future plans

## Covariate Metadata

This project includes a structured covariate metadata file to support
reproducibility, clarity, and consistency in modeling regional skew. The
metadata defines each covariate‚Äôs name, description, units, analytical
resolution, and conceptual grouping.

### Purpose

The covariate metadata documents all variables used in regional skew
modeling and spatial stratification. It is designed to ensure:

- consistent naming across scripts and visualizations,

- interpretable plots and maps,

- scalable use across spatial resolutions and modeling domains.

### Source

The original .xlsx file is stored as:
`docs/skew_covariates_metadata_v01.xlsx`

Older working versions are archived in: `docs/delete_later/`

### Script and Output Location

The script used to generate modular .csv files:
`docs/01_split-xlsx-into-csv.R`

Output .csv files (one per worksheet): `docs/covariates_metadata_split/`

### QA / Validation

A multi-step metadata quality checklist was used to validate content
before export. This includes checks for:

- completeness of key fields,

- consistency in phrasing and formatting,

- conceptual alignment across scales and groups,

- clarity and interpretability of variable description
